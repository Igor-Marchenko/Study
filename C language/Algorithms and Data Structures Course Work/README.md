The Course work in "Algorithms and Data Structures" is aimed to research the performance of different sorting algorithms. The task was given to write a sorting algorithms for a multidimensional arrays, to calculate the performance of written algorithms and to provide the analysis, comparing the performance of written algorithms with the performance of the algorithms given in a theory, and between each other. This work was written in a C language with a module principle as a requirement. The task was to write insertion, selection and exchange sorting algorithms.
